### Prerequisites
You need to have MySQL installed in your system. Once it is installed, make sure to run the admin script from the location `src/main/db/admin.sql`. This will create the necessary user `test` and the database `test` to integrate with the application.

### Running the Application
Run the following command in your commandline.

* Windows
```
$ gradlew update
```
* Unix
```
$ ./gradlew update
```
